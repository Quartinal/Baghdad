A new unblocked browser window exploit like Skiovox discovered by me. Credits to [GamerFromGamerTown](https://github.com/GamerFromGamerTown) and [SpaceSaver2000](https://github.com/SpaceSaver) for making 150.136.163.0 public.

![Status | Unpatched](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unpatched-green) ![Chrome OS Version | around 126](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome_OS_Version-around_126-green) ![DNS Used - 150.136.163.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/DNS_Used-150.136.163.0-green)

### Steps

**(a** 
  First, sign out of your Chromebook.

**(b**
  Second, make sure you are using a network with capable of having a custom name server value set.

**(c**
  Third, click the settings button located at the top right of the Wifi panel.

**(d**
  Fourth, set `Name servers` to `Custom name servers`.

**(e**
  Fifth, set the first `Custom name servers` value to `150.136.163.0`.

**(f**
  Sixth, you'll see a link on the normal sign-in screen that says `Visit this network's sign-in page`.

**(g**
  Once you see the sign-in page with a black background, click on `Webview link for tests`.

**(h**
  Now, finally, you can browse without any blocker extensions in your way!

### ~~Please note that the browser window will disappear after roughly one minute.~~

#### Also, I highly recommend you check out [S-PScript's](https://github.com/S-PScripts/incognito-v123) v123-v127 Incognito exploit writeup if you have flags enabled. Or if you don't, look at discussion [#1146](https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover/discussions/1146) or the ext-remover [discussions](https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover/discussions) for info on a new incognito exploit that works regardless of whether you have flags blocked (ps I tried it and only Securly and Securly Classroom were broken, so good luck).
